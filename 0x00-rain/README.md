# The Rain Problem

## Problem:
Given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls with unit width 1, as if viewing the cross-section of a relief map, calculate how many square units of water will be retained after it rains.

Visual representation of the walls [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4]
Rainwater retained: 6
